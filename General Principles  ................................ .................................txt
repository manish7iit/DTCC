**1. Overall Document Summary:**

These guidelines, based on Article 16(1) of ESMAâ€™s Regulation, aim to harmonize and standardize derivatives reporting under EMIR, starting April 29, 2024.  This standardization is crucial for effective systemic risk monitoring and cost containment across the reporting chain (counterparties, trade repositories (TRs), and authorities). The guidelines clarify aspects like transitioning to new reporting rules, reportable derivatives, intragroup exemptions, reporting delegation, data quality, and trade state report construction.  They specifically address the derivatives reporting obligation stated in Article 9 of EMIR and TR obligations under Articles 78 and 81.
