1. **Overall Document Summary:** This document outlines reporting obligations for derivative contracts, particularly those involving crypto-assets, under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (SFTR).  It clarifies which financial instruments are considered derivatives and thus reportable, including specific cases like total return swaps, complex contracts, and intragroup transactions.  The document also specifies which transactions, such as those with embedded derivatives and securitized derivatives, are not reportable under EMIR.  Finally, it clarifies reporting responsibilities for different counterparty types and scenarios.
