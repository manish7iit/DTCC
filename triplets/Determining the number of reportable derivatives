 "summary": "This document outlines reporting requirements for derivatives under updated Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and Implementing Technical Standards (ITS), requiring all counterparties to update outstanding derivatives within 180 days of the reporting start date using specific report types.",
 "key_points": [
   "All counterparties must update outstanding derivatives to comply with new RTS and ITS standards within 180 days",
   "Compliance must be achieved through 'Update', 'Modify', or 'Correct' report submissions",
   "Derivatives modified or terminated after the start date must adhere to new rules regardless of origination date",
   "The document addresses specific scenarios including collateral updates and handling of trade-level vs position-level derivatives",
   "Three distinct report types serve different functions: Update brings derivatives into compliance, Modify communicates changes, and Correct rectifies errors",
   "Outstanding derivatives are those active or unresolved as of the reporting start date",
   "Both individual derivative transactions and aggregated positions are subject to these requirements"
