  "summary": "This document outlines the regulatory reporting requirements under EMIR and SFTR for derivatives, including those based on crypto-assets. It clarifies which instruments and counterparties are subject to or exempt from reporting, the role of MiFID in classification, and special cases like total return swaps, complex contracts, and intragroup transactions.",
  "key_points": [
    "EMIR requires the reporting of most derivative contracts, including those involving crypto-assets if classified as financial instruments under MiFID.",
    "SFTR regulates specific securities financing transactions, including some total return swaps.",
    "Crypto-assets can underlie derivatives, which may or may not be reportable depending on classification under MiFID.",
    "Certain transactions, like embedded derivatives and securitized products, are exempt from EMIR reporting.",
    "Both financial (FC), non-financial (NFC), and central counterparties (CCPs) have defined reporting obligations under EMIR, though intragroup trades may be exempt."
