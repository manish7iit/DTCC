1. **Overall Document Summary:**

These guidelines, based on Article 16(1) of ESMAâ€™s Regulation, aim to harmonize and standardize derivatives reporting under EMIR, starting April 29, 2024.  This standardization is crucial for effective systemic risk monitoring and cost containment across the reporting chain (counterparties, trade repositories (TRs), and authorities). The guidelines clarify aspects like transitioning to the new rules, reportable derivatives, intragroup exemptions, reporting delegation, data quality, and trade state reporting.  The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of reported data used for regulatory oversight.
