1. **Overall Document Summary:** This document outlines the reporting requirements for derivatives under updated Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and Implementing Technical Standards (ITS).  All counterparties must update outstanding derivatives to comply with the new standards within 180 days of the reporting start date, primarily through 'Update', 'Modify', or 'Correct' reports.  Derivatives modified or terminated after the start date must also adhere to the new rules, regardless of their origination date.  The document clarifies specific scenarios like collateral updates, maturing derivatives, and the handling of trade-level vs. position-level derivatives.
